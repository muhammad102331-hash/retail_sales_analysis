### 1️⃣ Setting the Scene  
A mid-sized retail company wanted to understand why some months had strong sales while others were weak.  
They collected transaction data from their stores — including sales dates, customer ages, product categories, and total sales amounts.  

As a data analyst, I was tasked to explore this data using SQL and identify hidden patterns that could guide smarter decisions.

### 2️⃣ Discovering the Data  
When I first loaded the dataset (`Retail_Sales_Analysis_utf.csv`), I started by cleaning missing values and checking for unique customers, categories, and transaction counts.  
There were thousands of transactions spread across multiple product categories — each representing real customer interactions.

---

### 3️⃣ Asking the Right Questions  
I used SQL to dig deeper:  
- Which categories are generating the most revenue?  
- Who are our most valuable customers?  
- What time of day are sales the highest?  
- How does customer age affect purchase behavior?  

Each query revealed a new layer of understanding about how this business operates.

### 4️⃣ Insights Uncovered  
- 👕 Clothing and 💄 Beauty categories dominated total revenue.  
- 🧍‍♂️ Customers aged 25–35 made the majority of purchases — the core target group.  
- 🌞 Afternoons had the highest transaction counts — an ideal time for promotions.  
- 💰 A few loyal customers contributed a large share of sales — suggesting the potential for loyalty programs.  
- 📅 November and December consistently showed spikes in sales — highlighting strong seasonal demand.

### 5️⃣ Turning Insights into Action  
These findings can drive real business improvements:  
✅ Focus marketing on 25–35-year-olds.
